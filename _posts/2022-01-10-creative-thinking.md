## Creative thinking

Creative thinking is super important these days, and for a few clear reasons...

**Rapid change and uncertainty**
The world is changing at lightning speed—technology, economy, society… everything moves faster than ever. Creative thinking helps you stay flexible, find new solutions, and adapt to situations where there’s no ready-made playbook.

**Complex problems require new solutions**
Big challenges like climate change, digitalization, healthcare, or social inequality are complex. You can’t solve them with standard solutions. Creative thinking allows you to look at problems from different angles and come up with innovative ideas.

**Automation and AI are taking over routine tasks**
More and more tasks are being done by machines. What makes humans unique is our ability to think originally, connect ideas, and create new solutions. Creativity is therefore a skill you simply can’t miss.

**Innovation and competitiveness**
Companies and organizations that encourage creative thinking are often the most innovative. This applies not only to products but also to processes, services, and ways of working together.

**Personal development and self-expression**
Creative thinking helps you understand yourself better, express your ideas, and build confidence. It sparks curiosity and encourages lifelong learning.

**Collaboration and empathy**
Creative thinking often goes hand in hand with the ability to empathize with others. This leads to better communication, teamwork, and solutions that truly meet people’s needs.

In short: in a world that is complex, fast-moving, and unpredictable, creative thinking is not a luxury. It’s an **essential skill** for moving forward—both as an individual and as a society.
